## **CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**

#### In our Telco Customer churn project, we are armed with a dataset of approximately 7,000 records, encompassing 21 features such as demographics, subscribed services, and account information. The dataset includes a crucial termination flag, "Churn" (Yes/No). Our primary goal is to construct a robust classification model that effectively categorizes customers into two groups: Churn or Not Churn. This model not only serves as a predictive tool but also allows us to delve into the behavioral distinctions between existing customers and those who have terminated their services.


#### The project's significance extends beyond classification; it seeks to provide actionable insights. The analysis results will enable us to identify customers at high risk of unsubscribing in the next month, formulate targeted retention strategies, and refine product pricing for enhanced market competitiveness. Ultimately, the project aims to empower the company with data-driven strategies for customer retention and business growth.
