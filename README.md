## **CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**

#### In our Telco Customer churn project, we are armed with a dataset of approximately 7,000 records, encompassing 21 features such as demographics, subscribed services, and account information. Our primary goal is to construct a robust classification model that effectively categorizes customers into two groups: Churn or Not Churn. This model not only serves as a predictive tool but also allows us to delve into the behavioral distinctions between existing customers and those who have terminated their services.
